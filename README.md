# The Sqrrl Programming Language
The main source code repository for the Sqrrl compiler. This compiler is currently
under active development and is aimed towards game development. This compiler started
out as a school project but after increasing interest in compiler development I decided
to incorperate more functionality beyond the scope of my compiler construction course.
Currently the beta release is a simple prototype that shows simple code execution through
parsing and then interpreting the AST. 

# Goals
The goal is to support LLVM and allow for real-time 3D graphics rendering using OpenGL.

# Syntax
The syntax is inspired by the Jai and Rust programming languages. 
[Here is a taste of the new syntax!](https://github.com/Aleman778/sqrrl-lang/blob/impl/parser/examples/syntax.sq).
