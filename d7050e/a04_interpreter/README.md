# Assignment 4 - Implement an Interpreter from the AST
In this assignment we will create an interpreter using Structural Operational Semantics (SOS).
I will use the previous parser from assignment 2 to implement this interpreter. As an extra assignment
I will also try to implement operator precedence by using the precedence climbing algorithm.
